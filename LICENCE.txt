You can use this stuff and do whatever you like with it on the
following conditions:

0. Would you ever be in a situation where you are able to offer
   us, or one of us, a beer, or if unavailable, an alcoholic 
   beverage of your choice, you must do so.
1. If you fear you'll never be in aforementioned situation but want
   to offer us a beer anyway, you may do so. Contact us and we'll
   find a solution.
2. Otherwise, you may buy yourself a beer and use it anyway.
