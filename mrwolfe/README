w20e support system
===================

Handling support issues is an art! Ehh, well, it's actually pretty
simple. Mr. Wolfe is based on the asumption that you always have a
Service Level Agreement with for a given application that you expect
issues for, and a fixed number of people that can send issues for this
SLA.  Issues are sent over email by valid contacts, or added ttw by
authenticated users that are valid contacts. No SLA, no issue. Simple
as that.


Issues
------

An issue can be mailed to the dedicated mailqueue for an SLA, or to a
generic mailqueue. This mailqueue needs to be configured for the
SLA. The system will poll on the queue, fetch emails and dispatch to
the proper SLA. When the issue has been accepted by the system, a
notification is sent back to the sender, with the acknowledgement and
the issue id.


Resolving issues to an SLA
--------------------------

Issues are reported by email in general, so it is the system's
responsibility to attach incoming issues to the proper SLA. Resolving
this is done as per the followig algorithm:

1. if the mailqueue the issue was popped from is only used by one SLA,
this SLA is chosen
2. else, if the sender is in the contacts list and it is the contact for only 
one SLA, this SLA is chosen
3. else, if the name of the SLA (project) is found in the subject line or mail
body, this SLA is used
4. else the issue is considered an orphan

A Service Level Agreement consists of a number of services that have
been agreed upon. A service as basically a tuple of 'priority,
reaction time, solution time'.
