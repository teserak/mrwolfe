mrwolfe - "I'm Mr. Wolfe. I solve problems"
===========================================

Mr.Wolfe is an issue tracker for support issues. This is not the same
as a system for sofwtare issues, like Bugzilla, Jira, etc. In the
latter issues are related to software, and are tracked in terms of a
lifecylce from incoming to resolving in a specific software release
(or closing without a release). Mr.Wolfe on the other hand tracks
support issues, that may be questions, performance problems, software
failures, etc.  An issue in Mr.Wolfe may or may not result in a
software issue.

Issues in Mr.Wolfe are related to a Service Level Agreement, and are
handled according to the services agreed in the SLA. Several services
may be added to a SLA.

See the docs directory in the package for further reading.
